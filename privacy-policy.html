                            <p>We are committed to offering you a service that respects your privacy. A foundational belief of our business is that your data belongs to you, and that it is unethical for companies to buy and sell data without the express knowledge and consent of the human being who that data relates to. Wherever possible, we avoid collecting any data that is not critical for us to provide you with our services. If you have any questions about any of our terms, please email us on <a class="link-underline" href="mailto:hi@venox.io">hi@venox.io</a></p> 
                            <p>If you choose to use our service, then you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.</p>

                            <h2>We don’t collect unnecessary personal information</h2>
                            <p>We respect your privacy, and we know it's essential to hard-code that respect into a product like Venox. In order to provide our services, we’ll need to store and process private data in accordance with our Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering (AML) policies. We also require contact details and credentials that help us keep your account safe from unauthorised access. Your information and documents will be encrypted and securely stored.  </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>We keep your information private </h2>
                            <p>Venox protects client information and keeps it confidential. From time to time our trading partners may require client information as part of their compliance processes. Venox will communicate with clients in such situations and will never share your information with third parties outside of our partnerships, unless compelled to do so by legal authorities. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>Your data is stored and processed in South Africa </h2>
                            <p>The people who process your data work in the Republic of South Africa, and Venox IO (Pty) Ltd is a business that functions solely in the jurisdiction of the Republic of South Africa. </p>

                            <h2>Third Party Services & Partners </h2>
                            <p>Our technology platform and apps rely on third party services that may collect information used to identify you. Here are links to the privacy policies of those third party service providers: </p>
                            <ul class="list-1">
                                <li><a class="link-underline" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services </a></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Some of these third parties, like the App Store where you may have downloaded the Venox app, do have access to your personal information. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. We do not receive any personal information about you from these third parties. </p>
                            <p>Our app does not collect any data directly from your device (like your location data or contacts). </p>
                            <p>Venox also partners with trading desks and exchanges in order to buy and sell digital assets for our clients. Your information is not shared with these partners unless requested as part of their compliance processes. You will be notified in any such events. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>We collect log data </h2>
                            <p>In a case of an error in our apps we collect data and information (through third party products) on your device called log data. We will make sure that the services we use do not collect any personally identifiable data like IP addresses. However, the log data will include things like your device model, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilising our service, the time and date of your use of the service, and other statistics. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>Third party services may use cookies </h2>
                            <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. </p>
                            <p>Venox does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, Venox may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this service.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>We do our best to keep your data secure, and trust you will do the same </h2>
                            <p>We value your trust in providing us your data, and we work hard to protect that data. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                            <p>It is your responsibility to secure your physical device. If someone steals your phone and is able to open the Venox app, they may be able to see your information. For this reason, we recommend that you protect your phone with a passcode, thumbprint or face recognition. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>Your data is a transferable asset </h2>
                            <p>If we ever sold or transferred ownership of our app (super unlikely), any data collected as part of this service would be transferred to the new owner. You will be alerted well in advance, and given the opportunity to close your account and remove its data before any such transfer takes place. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>We will let you know if our terms change </h2>
                            <p>We can also choose to change the terms of this policy at any time, but we promise that we will alert you if we do, over email, at least 15 days before the new terms become effective. </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
